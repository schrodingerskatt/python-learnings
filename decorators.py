# we can call a function inside a funcction, and can return a function
'''
In python, functions are first class first class objects which means functions can be used or passed as
arguments.
1. A function is an instance of the Object type.
2. You can store the function in a variable.
3. You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.
4. You can return the function from a function.
5. You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists, â€¦

# can be treated as objects 
def shout(text): 
	return text.upper() 

print(shout('Hello')) 
yell = shout 
print(yell('Hello')) 

# can be passed as arguments to other functions 
def shout(text): 
	return text.upper() 

def whisper(text): 
	return text.lower() 

def greet(func): 
	# storing the function in a variable 
	greeting = func("""Hi, I am created by a function passed as an argument.""") 
	print (greeting) 

greet(shout) 
greet(whisper) 

# Functions can return another function

	def adder(y): 
		return x+y 

	return adder 

add_15 = create_adder(15) 

print(add_15(10))

Decorators are used to modify the behaviour of function or class. 
In Decorators, functions are taken as the argument into another function and 
then called inside the wrapper function.
